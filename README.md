# MailMemo
## Description

MailMemo consolidates events from all your calendars in one place and sends personalized email reminders at your preferred time of day, frequency of reminders, and time range of events to cover.

This has several benefits:

- Connecting all of your calendars
- Selecting when to receive reminders
- Receiving a consolidated, organized update directly in your email inbox
